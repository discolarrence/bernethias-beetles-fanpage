#   Bernethia's Beetles Fanpage
https://discolarrence.github.io/bernethias-beetles-fanpage

##  Project Description
-   This project is to practice and demonstrate what I have learned in my Code Louisville Front End Development class.

##  Required Features
-   CSS
    -   The main navigation menu reorganizes for mobile, tablet and desktop views.

    -   The signup form is organized using CSS Grid, and reorganizes for mobile, tablet and desktop views.

-   JS
    -   Clicking imgs in the "Meet My Beetles!" section reveals a related modal with a bio and larger picture. Clicking the "X" icon on the modal will hide it.

    -   When user clicks the button in the signup form, the required fields are validated, and, if in the correct format, the values are displayed in a welcome message to the user. 

    -   If required form field input is in the incorrect format or missing, an array is populated with corresponding error messages. These messages are then displayed on the page by looping through the array.

##  Notes for Reviewer
-   The form is validated client side only, and user input is not stored.
